== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What gets removed when I delete the plugin? =
**Everything!** Version 1.4.4 features comprehensive cleanup that removes:
- All plugin configuration options
- All FormSpammerTrap core options (fst_* database entries)
- Upload folder and all files (including security files)
- FormSpammerTrap database tables (if any)
- Scheduled cleanup tasks
- Cached data and transients
Your site will be completely clean with zero leftover data.

= Will deleting this plugin affect my other form plugins? =
No! The cleanup system only targets FormSpammerTrap-specific data (fst_* and formspammertrap* patterns). Your Contact Form 7, WPForms, Gravity Forms, and other plugins are completely safe.

= Why do I need FormSpammerTrap files? =
This plugin integrates with the FormSpammerTrap system, which provides the core anti-spam functionality. The FormSpammerTrap files contain the proven spam protection algorithms.

= Can I use my Gmail address to receive emails? =
No, the email address must be on your domain (e.g., contact@yourdomain.com). This prevents delivery issues and spam filtering.

= Are uploaded files secure? =
Yes! The plugin automatically creates .htaccess protection to prevent direct URL access to uploaded files. Files are also automatically deleted based on your retention settings for privacy compliance.

= What file types can visitors upload? =
You can configure allowed file extensions in the admin settings. Common safe types include: .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .doc, .docx. Dangerous file types like .php are automatically blocked.

= How long are uploaded files kept? =
You can set retention periods of 7, 14, 30, or 90 days. Files are automatically deleted via daily cron jobs. The recommended setting is 30 days for GDPR compliance.

= Can visitors access uploaded files directly? =
No, the plugin automatically creates security protection that blocks direct URL access to uploaded files. Only site administrators can access them through the server.

= Why doesn't the submit button appear immediately? =
This is a security feature. The submit button appears after visitors interact with required fields, preventing automated submissions.

= What happens if I disable file uploads? =
The upload folder and cleanup schedule are automatically managed. Disabling uploads stops new uploads but doesn't affect existing files until their retention period expires.

= How much storage do uploaded files use? =
The Security Status dashboard shows real-time file count and storage usage. The automatic cleanup prevents unlimited storage growth.

= Can I use this on multiple sites? =
Yes, but each site needs its own FormSpammerTrap setup and email configuration.

= Is reCAPTCHA required? =
No, FormSpammerTrap provides effective protection without requiring CAPTCHA.

= What happens to spam submissions? =
Spam submissions are automatically blocked and redirected. No spam emails reach your inbox.
