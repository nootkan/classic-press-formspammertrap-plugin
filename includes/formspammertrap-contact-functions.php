	INSTRUCTIONS

	General documentation and customization information in fthe associated PDF files that came with the FST program (request the latest version from the https://wwww.FormSpammerTrap.com site). Please read the documentation to help with implementation on your site.

	IF YOU NEED HELP - Use the contact form on the FormSpammerTrap site.

	WE CAN DO YOUR IMPLEMENATION - we'll do all of the implementation work for a nominal fee. Contact us for details. Simple implementation can be completed within 24 hours.

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE ANY VALUES IN THIS FILE - THINGS MIGHT BREAK!

	There is one required setting that you must include in your contact form code. This setting - and all customized settings - is placed in the FST_MORE_FIELDS() function that you MUST add to your contact page.

	IF YOU CHANGE THINGS IN THIS FILE, IT MIGHT BREAK THE WHOLE THING !!!!!

	DO NOT CHANGE ANY FIELDS IN THIS FILE !!!!!!!

	(I tell you three times! [even more than three times] )

	See the documentation.    (RTF docs!)

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	DON"T CHANGE ANY OF THESE  VALUES OR THE CODE - OR ANYTHING IN THIS FILE !!!!

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	- These are all of the optional settings available.
	- We recommend that you change these values in your contact form page, not in this file.
	- See the formspammertrap-sample-contact-extended.php file for an example of how to customize the settings, including adding additonal fields to your form.
	- Putting the customized values in your contact form page will make your form compatible with future versions - because your customized settings are not in this file .
	- Overriding values in your custom contact form will allow you to easily use FST in multiple contact forms.
	- These additional settings are available for advanced users. The basic form only needs the one required FST_XEMAIL_ON_DOMAIN setting that is placed in the FST_MORE_FIELDS function in your contact form. This is the recipient email for the message, which must be a valid email on your domain.
	- NOte that the FST_XEMAIL_ON_DOMAIN will default to noreply@your-domain-name . If this is not a valid email, the message will disappear into the bit bucket.
